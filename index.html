    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      The provided HTML code creates a simple webpage with the title "<b

    <h3>What is Web3?</h3>
    <p>
      The web3 ecosystem is a decentralized web built on blockchain technology,
      comprising decentralized applications (DApps), smart contracts,
      cryptocurrencies, and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.
    </p>
    <p>An overview of the web3 ecosystem:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <dl>
          <dt><b>Blockchain Technology</b>:</dt>
          <dd>
            A distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of
            records, called blocks, secured from tampering and revision.
            <p>TYPES OF BLOCKCHAIN
                <ul>
